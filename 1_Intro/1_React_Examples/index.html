    //render is basically a method that is part of reactDOM.render() it just internally goes to react and ask
    //which method we can efficiently get into the UI and then react tells it to put it on the UI
     
    //babel is a javascript compiler that can help you convert one language into other
    //Here we should convert react into javascript as browser only understands html,css and java script
    
    //React is just an algorithm that react DOM uses to change the UI by just calling
    // React.render function

    //we get data from API and we use map function then react automatically uses that and prints output

<!--  
 1. component: Components are independent and reusable bits of code. 
 They serve the same purpose as JavaScript functions, 
 but work in isolation and return HTML
 2. Prop : properties passed to a component
3. JSX -> Javascript and XML
4. you create bigger components using smaller component
